# Movie-Recommendation-System-Using-Collaborative-Filtering
Description:
This project focuses on building a movie recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering. The system processes and cleans movie datasets, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and extracting key features. It then constructs a content-based filtering mechanism by combining genres and keywords to compute movie similarity using a CountVectorizer and cosine similarity.

The model suggests movies similar to a given title based on feature similarity, providing personalized recommendations without requiring extensive user preferences. The approach serves as a strong baseline for recommendation systems and can be further refined with hybrid techniques.
